# Installation

```
cd /usr/local/directadmin/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/poralix/load_monitor.git
cd load_monitor/scripts/
./install.sh
```

Go to Directadmin panel as admin and click "Load Monitor"

Then go to the plugin settings and update:

- Maximum days to remember loads: default 91 (0 = all, more days = more space)
- Maximum task entries to save: default 91 (0 = all, more tasks = more space)
- Save interval in minutes: default 1

91 days of data with 1 minutes intervals might take up to 2Gb disk space and more.


# Warnings and requirements

Time Zone is taken from `/usr/local/directadmin/custombuild/options.conf`. Make sure the value of `php_timezone=` corresponds to your actual Time Zone.

The plugin loads JavaScript files from Google to draw graphs, i.e. it uses Google's libraries for drawing graphs. Your browser should be allowed to load JS from Google.

Supported and tested OS:

- CentOS 6 and 7
- Debian 8

Potentially can work under  Debian versions (not tested though).

# FAQ:

- Q: Time zone is wrong what to do?
- A: Change Time Zone in `php_timezone=` of `/usr/local/directadmin/custombuild/options.conf`. And update the plugin.
